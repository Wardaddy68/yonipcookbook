        <h6> How to Cook:</h6>
            <ol>
                <li> Boil the whole pig leg then put the bay leaves, salt, and peppercorns</li>
                <li> Wait until the whole pig leg is tender.</li>
                <li> Strain the whole pig leg until temperature sets down. </li>
                <li> Rub the leg with garlic powder, ground black pepper, and remaining salt. Let stand for 15 minutes to absorb the rub.</li>
                <li> Heat a clean large cooking pot (preferably with cover) and pour-in cooking oil.</li>
                <li> When the oil becomes hot, deep fry the rubbed pork leg. Continue cooking in medium heat until one side <br> becomes <br> crispy, and then cautiously flip the leg to crisp the other side.</li>
                <li> Turn-off the heat; remove the crispy pork leg; and transfer it to a wide serving plate.</li>
                <li> Enjoy and eatwell! </li>
